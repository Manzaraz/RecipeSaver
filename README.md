## An app where you can save all your recipes

👋🏼 Hello everyone, I am Chris and today I am thrilled to introduce you to RecipeSaver, the latest project I have been working on for the past few days. RecipeSaver is an incredible app designed to help you save and organize all your favorite recipes in one convenient place. Inspired by the popular application Spiciko, RecipeSaver brings a seamless experience to managing your culinary creations. Whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting out in the kitchen, RecipeSaver is here to simplify your cooking journey. Get ready to discover a whole new level of recipe organization and culinary inspiration with RecipeSaver.

at the bottom of the screen you have a tab user interface that switches between the main screens of the application. The home screen presents a list of recipes in the form of remotely stored picture cards. Each card can be redirected to a specific recipe that describes its details. Recipes can also be accessed from categories where recipes are filtered by food type. All of that was for navigational purposes.
