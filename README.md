üëãüèº Hello everyone, I'm Chris, a full-stack developer in JavaScript who is currently sharpening my skills in Swift development for iOS. And as a practice, I would like to present to you the latest project I've been working on: RecipeSaver. This app is inspired by the app Spiciko and will allow you to organize all your recipes in one place. Whether you are experienced chefs or just starting out in the kitchen, this app will be very useful to you.

The idea behind RecipeSaver is to simplify your daily life in the kitchen. You can browse recipes in the app and get inspired when preparing a meal to surprise your loved ones. Let's take a walk through the app:

In the main layout, you will find a list of recipes with photos and dish names. By clicking on a recipe, you can access its complete content, which includes a photo, an introduction, the ingredients, and the instructions to prepare the dish.

In addition, in the bottom toolbar of the layout, you can choose to search by categories. You can filter dishes by dessert, appetizer, or main course. You can also add your own creations in the "New" section, where you can enter the data in a form. The buttons will be selectively enabled to avoid saving something that you haven't finished editing. Once saved, you can find your creations in the general list of the main window.

RecipeSaver is a practical and versatile tool for all cooking enthusiasts. I hope you enjoy exploring and organizing your recipes with this app!
