            description: "with these produce-packed sliders. Mushrooms, chickpeas, zucchini, onion, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes come together to form the succulent, savory patties, while balsamic-infused zucchini slices serve as buns. These sliders are on the smaller side; if you place them directly on the grill, you run the risk of losing them through the grates. We recommend using a grill pan when cooking them on the grill or on the stove.",
            ingredients: "½ cup chopped onion\n½ cup coarsely chopped fresh mushrooms\n½ cup coarsely chopped zucchini\n1 clove garlic, minced\n¾ cup no-salt-added chickpeas, rinsed and drained, and liquid (aquafaba) reserved\n¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (not oil packed)\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, crushed\n½ teaspoon lemon zest\nSea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n¼ cup cornmeal\n1large zucchini, cut lengthwise into ½-inch-thick planks\n2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n8 slices roma tomato",
            directions: "In a large skillet cook the first four ingredients (through garlic) over medium 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water, 1 to 2 Tbsp. at a time, as needed to prevent sticking. Place in a food processor with the chickpeas, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and lemon zest. Cover and pulse until chunky but not pureed. Add 1 to 2 Tbsp. of the aquafaba if the mixture seems dry or isn’t sticking together. Mixture should be moist but not wet. Season with salt and pepper.\nWith wet hands, shape bean mixture into eight patties. Chill at least 20 minutes. Lightly dredge patties in cornmeal to coat.\nHeat a grill pan over medium-high. Cook sliders 8 to 10 minutes or until browned and heated through, turning once. Brush zucchini planks with some of the balsamic vinegar. Cook in grill pan 4 to 6 minutes or until crisp-tender and grill marks appear, turning once. Cut planks into 16 pieces for “buns.” Place sliders and tomato slices between plank pieces. Drizzle with any remaining vinegar.",

Cover and cook about 15 minutes more or until lentils are tender. Uncover and cook until any remaining liquid has evaporated.\nStir in the next seven ingredients (through salt and pepper). Cook, uncovered, over low about 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and pan is very dry, stirring occasionally. (Watch carefully so lentils do not scorch.) Spread mixture in a shallow baking pan; cool completely.\nPreheat oven to 250°F. Line a 15×10-inch baking pan with parchment paper.

            description: "Kale ribs are often discarded during the cooking process because they’re tougher than the tender leaves. Instead of throwing them in the bin, toss them into boiling water with some whole wheat orzo to add a subtle crunch in this colorful pasta salad. Vibrant orange bell pepper, creamy artichoke hearts, and tangy shallot transform the simple base into a garden feast that is packed with good-for-you ingredients.
